---Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to get you familiarized with CI-CD Pipeline for Creating docker images after successfull build.


You already built 2 app(client and server) from the "Part 1" Assignment.


NOTE: You should be able to get the docker image for both Client and Server after successfull build using Jenkins Pipeline.


Your Client app and Server app must be in the github.
Whenever developer commits changes to client/server app in github, it should trigger a build on Jenkins.
Jenkins Pipeline should do maven clean and package
Jenkins Pipeline should also do the static-code analysis using (checkstyle/sonarqube)
Jenkins pipeline at the end should create docker image
On build failure, Jenkins pipeline should send an email to any emailId about the failure.
