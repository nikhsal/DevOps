The GNU Project --> Richard Stallman
	Its aim is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices, by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on the following freedom rights: users are free to run the software, share it (copy, distribute), study it and modify it. GNU software guarantees these freedom-rights legally (via its license), and is therefore free software; the use of the word "free" always being taken to refer to freedom.



	Linux Kernel + GNU = Linux Distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, etc...)
